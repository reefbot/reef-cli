# first go through files and extract all definitions and imports
#    filter out imports from outside of the project
# next go through files again
#    find function calls
#    find definition using imports
#    add as node to function definition node


# Scan through and find all local imports - these will act as a map for collecting dependent files for a selected function or class


# To Do:
# imports need qualified name
# Select a refactor candidate (random selection for now)
# retrieve all imports that match repr


# Possible Additions
# Scan for function and class usages and calls (difficult as need to consider dependency injection etc)
